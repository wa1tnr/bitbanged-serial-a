The purpose of using the TX pin, since this isn't a USART
application, is so as to not have to change the wiring,
when the USART is (later) utilized.

The program is a stopgap for before that occurs.

In this way, progress can be made, from a spartan
system without extra libraries known (or on hand).

USART use is considered a refinement difficult to
attain, in this context.

Good solid program.  115,200 bps on TX_D1 PA17 ItsyBitsyM4.

Program goal: write data from a primitive program, via
TTL serial, to capture the state of the machine in an
external venue (a tty - a serial terminal).

Program goal is met.  Rediscovered older work, and ported
to ItsyBitsyM4 (was originally a Feather M4 design).

This new branch, itsybitsym4-b was instantiated after the
release was posted.

New development goes in this branch (itsybitsym4-b) during
or after November 2020.


TODO: post the old scope trace photo.

PB16 probably the only pin used at the moment, for
the serial TX function.

Feather M4 assigns it as TX_D1 or SERCOM5.0

Want same on ItsyBitsyM4, if mapped already. ;)

Later: PA17 seems required for ItsyBitsyM4.  That is, its
schematic says PA17 is mapped to TX_D1 per what was used
for Feather M4.

GOOD NEWS!

System seems to compile fine.  Have not tested the
resulting firmware on a target MCU, however.

Still .. seems to compile cleanly, indicating this
is a complete source tree. ;)

Entirely untested - old code.  May compile, or not. ;)

Old commit may be a good description of this project,
or not, as follows:

    Working TX pin serial annunciator (talks to PiUART 38400 bps)
     modified:   main.c
    On branch clockey-amrt-aa-8_AUG-e-
    
    For soft front panels and the like
