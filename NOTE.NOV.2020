PB16 probably the only pin used at the moment, for
the serial TX function.

Feather M4 assigns it as TX_D1 or SERCOM5.0

Want same on ItsyBitsyM4, if mapped already. ;)

GOOD NEWS!

System seems to compile fine.  Have not tested the
resulting firmware on a target MCU, however.

Still .. seems to compile cleanly, indicating this
is a complete source tree. ;)

Entirely untested - old code.  May compile, or not. ;)

Old commit may be a good description of this project,
or not, as follows:

    Working TX pin serial annunciator (talks to PiUART 38400 bps)
     modified:   main.c
    On branch clockey-amrt-aa-8_AUG-e-
    
    For soft front panels and the like
