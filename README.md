Bitbanged Serial

This seems to be a variant of ainsuForth-d51, privately
held as expA (experiment 'A' iirc).

https://github.com/wa1tnr/ainsuForth-d51.git

If that's the case, it's an Atmel Start based experiment
on serial output, using only software.

Hardware: Probably Feather M4 Express.

At this writing (November 2020) there's just the one C source
file, distinguished by 'bit_CLR' and 'bit_SET' utterances

(That will probably identify the correct file uniquely).
