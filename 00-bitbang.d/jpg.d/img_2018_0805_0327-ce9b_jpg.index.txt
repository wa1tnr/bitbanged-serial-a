Image of an oscilloscope trace. Image created during the project,
and depicts a favorable keystroke character on the oscilloscope.

It's favorable because of its regular pattern (many characters
that can be sent exhibit no such regularity; the chosen pattern
was found to be one of the most regular patterns available).

Might have been capital 'U' (as in 'Uniform').
